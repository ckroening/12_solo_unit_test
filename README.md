# Prime Solo Unit Testing Challenge

Use QUnit to test your implementation of a queue.

Some code has been added for you. Please look for TODO comments to guide you.

## Hard Mode
A set is another common data type. In fact, it is part of ECMASCript 6.

[Read about](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) and implement the following
Set methods in a Set object:

- add
- clear
- delete
- has
- values (which should return an array of items, not an iterator)

Write unit tests for all of your methods.

## Pro Mode
Like math? Add some additional functions to your Set:

- union
- intersect
- minus

Of course, you need to write tests for these new methods.
